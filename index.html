          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project visualizes the most important social determinants of health correlated with cardiovascular
            disease death rates across U.S. counties over time. By integrating real-world data and predictive forecasts,
            the map highlights key variables such as years of potential life lost rate, uninsured rates, and more,
            providing users with a dynamic tool to explore associations between these factors and health disparities at
            the county level.<br><br>

            Key features of this project include:<br><br>

            <strong>Yearly Data Visualization</strong>: Users can explore data across different years, from 2015 to
            2023, and examine forecasted trends for 2024 and 2025. The color-coded map provides an intuitive way to
            understand which social determinants are most strongly correlated with cardiovascular health outcomes in
            each county.<br><br>

            <strong>In Depth Unique County Information</strong>: Users can click on counties to zoom into a specific
            county. Once the user clicks into a zoomed county, the website will bring up a county-specific page
            displaying a line chart of death rates (including a forecast), and the most important variables for each
            year.<br><br>

            <strong>Interactive Search and Navigation</strong>: The map allows users to search for specific counties by
            name or FIPS code, providing an easy way to zoom in on areas of interest. The interactive legend helps users
            filter the map to focus on particular health determinants.<br><br>

            <strong>Forecasting Future Trends</strong>: By incorporating forecast data, users can gain insights into how
            the most critical health determinants are expected to change, helping policymakers and health professionals
            make informed decisions about future interventions.<br><br>

            This project serves as a valuable tool for public health officials, researchers, and anyone interested in
            understanding and addressing the factors associated with cardiovascular disease at the local level. The data
            used for this project is a combination of <a
