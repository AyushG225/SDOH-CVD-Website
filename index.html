          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project visualizes the most important social determinants of health affecting
            cardiovascular disease death rates across U.S. counties over time. By integrating real-world data and
            predictive
            forecasts, the map highlights key variables such as years of potential life lost rate, uninsured rates, and
            more, providing users with a dynamic tool to explore health disparities at the county level.<br><br>

            Key features of this project include:<br><br>

            <strong>Yearly Data Visualization</strong>: Users can explore data across different years, from 2015 to
            2023,
            and examine forecasted trends for 2024 and 2025. The color-coded map provides an intuitive way to understand
            which social determinants have the most significant impact on cardiovascular health in each county.<br><br>

            <strong>In Depth Unique County Information</strong>: Users can click on counties to zoom into a specific
            county.
            Once the user clicks into a zoomed county, the website will bring up a county unique page displaying a line
            chart of death rates (including a forecast), and the most important variables each year.<br><br>

            <strong>Interactive Search and Navigation</strong>: The map allows users to search for specific counties by
            name
            or FIPS code, providing an easy way to zoom in on areas of interest. The interactive legend helps users
            filter
            the map to focus on particular health determinants.<br><br>

            <strong>Forecasting Future Trends</strong>: By incorporating forecast data, users can gain insights into how
            the
            most critical health determinants are expected to evolve, helping policymakers and health professionals make
            informed decisions about future interventions.<br><br>

            This project serves as a valuable tool for public health officials, researchers, and anyone interested in
            understanding and addressing the factors contributing to cardiovascular disease at the local level.
