        <h4>Cardiovascular Disease Death Rate Information</h4>
        <p>This chart illustrates the cardiovascular disease death rate over time, combining historical data and
          forecasts. The solid line represents the actual data, while the dashed line shows the forecasted data. The
          forecast is based on a machine learning model, while the actual death rates are from CDC's Wonder Database.
          These death rates are a combination of the "Underlying Cause of Death" and "Provisional Mortality Statistics"
          for the set of "disorders of the ciruclatory system," which largely includes cardiovascular disease along with
          vascular diseases.</p>

        <h4>Feature Weights Information</h4>
        <p>This table displays the most important features that influence cardiovascular disease in the county for the
          selected year, along with their corresponding weights. The higher the weight, the more significant the
          feature. These weights are calculated by multiplying each feature's importance based on the machine learning
          model, and the scaled value of the county for the selected year, on a scale from 0 to 1.</p>
